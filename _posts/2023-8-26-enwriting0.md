Mastering English is important for my future research and academic life. My current level is not quite up to standard, which makes me somewhat envious of those children who are young and good at English. In fact, I know that I should work hard on the dimensions that include vocabulary, reading, listening, speaking and writing. I am also trying to make plans and use advanced technology to improve my basic skills. I want to increase my vocabulary by studying Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder and improve my reading skills by getting into the habit of reading English magazines from time to time. I want to improve my listening skills by listening to podcasts on my iPhone at every meal, while I want to improve my speaking skills by talking to myself or reading aloud the texts of video games. Finally, I'm trying to write English blogs with the help of AI to improve my writing skills. This is also why I wrote this text.
